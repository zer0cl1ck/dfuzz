# dfuzz
dfuzz is a Python-based, multithreaded directory fuzzing tool that scans multiple URLs (from a file) using a single wordlist, similar to dirsearch. It supports recursive scanning, customizable status code filtering, and an optional deduplication feature to skip repeated content lengths, helping reduce noise in results.
